  "info2": "\nThis app is designed to help users master the months of the year in a fun and easy way, while exploring the different seasons.",
  "info3": "\nImplementation: Lucija Lovrić\nSupervision: prof. Željka Car PhD and Ana Radović, MSc in Computer Engineering",
  "aboutTitle": "Application informations",
  "about1": "This mobile application is based on the principle of ‘multiple means of representation’ from Universal Design for Learning (UDL) to provide an interactive and personalized educational experience for learning the months of the year.",
  "about2": "\nThe application was developed in accordance with ICT-AAC guidelines, with a focus on accessibility, content clarity, and adaptation for users with various communication needs.",
  "about3": "\nIt is intended for a wide audience, including children, people with disabilities, and learners of Croatian and English.",
  "about4": "\nThis serious game is designed to guide the user through three different stages: learning about the months, practicing, and testing knowledge of the months.",
  "about5": "\nThe user will learn about the months within each season (winter, spring, summer, autumn) through a sequential approach. After learning about the months in each season, this knowledge will be practiced with a simple matching game. Once the user is familiar with all the months, they will have the opportunity to test their acquired knowledge in the form of a quiz. At the end of the quiz, the user’s score will be displayed.",
